lib/sylvester.addons.js

This is a piece of sample code extracted from a WebGL tutorial. I could no 
longer find the original source/author of the code, but a Google search for its
first line: "// augment Sylvester some" revealed that it's in widespread use.

I'm going to assume a MIT/BSD license here, since that's usual. If you're/know
the original author, drop me a message and I'll attribute you/him. (Or, if you
have problems with me using this code, drop me a message and I'll replace it
with something else.)

A Note About Sonic the Hedgehog Intelectual Property
----------------------------------------------------

"Sonic the Hedgehog" is a registered trademark of SEGA Corporation. Some 
specific Sonic gameplay elements might be also patented by SEGA Corporation.

All the code and assets included on this distribution are completely
new/original material. This includes the textures, objects and the Sonic 
3D model. NO CONTENT OR DATA "RIPPED" OR SOMEHOW "PIRATED" FROM ANY SONIC GAME
IS INCLUDED ALONG WITH THIS CODE.

The Sonic-related content on this distribution therefore violates NO COPYRIGHTS,
but might violate trademark and patent rights, since it's used without express,
written permission from SEGA.

This is considered NOT TO be the case, due to:

  1. The purely artistic/hobby nature of the content, comparable to
  fanfiction, fan-art or sculpures depicting Sonic the Hedgehog;
  
  2. The strictly non-commercial license on which the Sonic related assets
  are distributed;

  3. The existing good/strong bounds between the personal from SEGA and the 
  Sonic fanbase;
  
  4. Large amounts of similar, precedent material regarding which SEGA
  Corporation expressed no opposition or no concern (hundreds of existing Sonic
  fan-games)

If you make use of the source on this distribution to create, specifically,
a Sonic fan-game, you're STRONGLY ADVISED not to directly or indirectly profit 
from it. (e.g. selling licenses or advertising in game) Unless, of course, 
you're authorized to do so by SEGA Corporation (which is totally cool, then.)

This is obviously NOT an obligation, since the code is MIT licensed, but not
following this advice WILL likely get you into legal trouble, and may backfire 
at the Sonic fan-gaming community as a whole.

If you make use of the source code on this distribution for anything else, do
as you please. Just honor the MIT license.
